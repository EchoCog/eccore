## üß† AI Architecture Highlights

The new architecture documentation introduces several key concepts:

### Recursive Cognitive Cycles

The Deep Tree Echo system operates through recursive feedback loops between four cognitive subsystems:

- **Memory Subsystem**: Hyperdimensional encoding and associative networks
- **AI Subsystem**: Multi-modal reasoning and parallel cognitive processing
- **Autonomy Subsystem**: Identity management and meta-cognitive reflection
- **Task Subsystem**: Action orchestration and multimodal capabilities

### Neural-Symbolic Integration

The architecture seamlessly blends symbolic reasoning with neural processing through:

- Quantum-inspired belief propagation networks
- Hypergraph-centric knowledge representation
- Emergent pattern recognition across conversation history

### Emergent Intelligence Mechanisms

The system exhibits emergent properties through:

- Self-modifying cognitive parameters
- Adaptive attention allocation mechanisms
- Recursive self-reflection and autonomous identity evolution

For detailed technical specifications and Mermaid diagrams, see the comprehensive [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md) documentation.

_This documentation supports the distributed cognition approach outlined in the Deep Tree Echo cognitive architecture, enabling all contributors to understand and extend the system's emergent intelligence capabilities._
